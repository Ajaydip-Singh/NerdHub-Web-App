## The Problem

NerdHub is a gaming company based in Nairobi, Kenya. The aim of Nerdhub is to give its members a platform to be able to earn
through Esports just like in first world countries. The founders of NerdHub believe that the gaming community in Kenya lacks
a platform to show their talent. To achieve this aim, the NerdHub App (this repo) was developed by the developer.

## Part of the solution (this App)

NerdHub is developed using react as it's frontend and express as it's server. MongoDB was used as the database and redux for state management. 

The official hosting of this project is maintained by the team at Nerdhub. The unofficial, demo of this web application is however hosted [here](https://nerdhubkenya.herokuapp.com/).
The hosting platform is [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform) using the free tier (thus there might be a delay on the first request if you choose to
explore the demo). 

## Notable Features

- Authentication (with Google, email)
- Email confirmation (thanks to free tier of [sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for this as well)
- CMS (Content Management System) for admin user
- Ecommerce
- Events Registration
- [Pesapal](https://www.pesapal.com/) for payment solution in Nairobi, Kenya.
